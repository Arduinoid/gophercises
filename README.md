# Gophercises

This repo represents my solutions to the exercises found at [Gophercises.com](https://gophercises.com) created by **Jon Calhoun**

## Purpose

I am attempting to learn [Go](https://golang.org/) and this will be my first serious effort in doing so. I've made attempts in the passed but only in short bursts or noodling in the [playground](https://goplay.space/) *(totally check out this particular playground as it has syntax highlighting and a panel to the side containing realtime documentation)*

I've also made the mistake of engaging in more reading than practice. This time I'm flipping it over and only reading when I'm stuck, need to look up standard lib usage, or gain a better understanding how something works for just the task at hand. Much like I do in my day job when tackling a new feature or problem.

## Prerogative 

> I find it difficult to come up with ideas for what to build while learning something new. These exercises help to lift that burden while I focus on learning ad solving problems. It also keeps me from recalibrating the project to make solving a problem easier.

I will be building solutions to each of these exercises in such a way to maximize learning. To achieve this I will be refactoring and building test with each exercises before moving on. This should allow me to get familiar with the the workflow and idioms of Go.

### Exercise Plan

1. Solve the exercise *(just get it working)*
2. write tests and attempt 100% coverage
3. refactor the code 
4. make it idiomatic *(try to do things the "Go" way)*
